## About
This project is a full-stack e-commerce website built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It was created as a learning project for full-stack development and includes features such as user authentication, product browsing, cart management. 

This website is heavily inspired by the streetwear retail store carnivalbkk.com. I am proud to credit them as a major source of inspiration for product offerings and overall aesthetic.
